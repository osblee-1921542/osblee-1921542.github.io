									<h1>People</h1>
								</header>
								<p>This is a long paragraph about people that I am writing. I'm sure no one will read this as this is for my assignment that is practically a check off. I am personalizing my website and I'm hopeful that I can attain the Master Level for this assignment. I am just writing and writing and hoping that no one reads this. I actually wrote real stuff for the photo descriptions and for my about me (well as real as it's gonna get), but for this one in particular, I don't think I need to. I'm just writing and writing and writing. But what should be here is something about how I met lots of people on my journey and like a wise old man talking about how great it is to meet people. I need to fill up a bit more space here with nonsense, but I think that this should be good soon. This should just be all about how people visiting is good and visiting different cultures is good and everything is good. I'm portraying myself as a hippie so like, yup. Osbert Lee, the hippie. Nice. </p>
								<h2>Culture Shock</h2>
								<p>This should be a long winded paragraph about how there is a huge culture shock when I travel places and I want to capture that memory in a photo. Anyways, I'm currently writting this while Jill is talking about how we need to think about how uw registration is bad. I hope I can multitask properly. She seemed very stressed today about something that happened in the iSchool? I hope everything is okay. I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to these types of things. Shoot, i don't think I was paying attention to the instructions. Hopefully someone will tell me.</p>

										<h3>Gillian Soon</h3>
										<p>
											This is a photo of Gillian Soon, I met her when I went to Austraia. She works an 9-5 job as a mother and she is a wonderful person to be around. I asked if I could take some photos of her and she was completely okay with it.

										<h3>Hannah Figzes</h3>
										<p>
											This is a paragraph about Hannah Figzes. Hopefully, Jill doesn't read these. Most of them, I'm not sure what to write about? I feel like the information on these pages don't really matter, but rather a mastery of concept. And I can take a template and work on it like it's mine for sure.
